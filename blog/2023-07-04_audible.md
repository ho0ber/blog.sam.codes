I'm an avid audiobook listener, but I sometimes struggle with losing my place in my books if I fall asleep while listening or if my book autoplays on my (muted) car stereo for a long drive. This project is an attempt to help me find my lost place.

I listen to books almost exclusively on Audible. I know, I know, I really shouldn't be feeding Amazon even more money, but I already have a large library there, and I have a very good setup for listening to my books while I fall asleep or drive (ideally not both at the same time).

One of the features of Audible that I use most frequently is the ability to pick up where I left off in my book on a different device. Unfortunately, this feature can be a bit buggy. Occasionally, I'll start playing on a device I haven't used in a while and it will start my book from dozens of chapters back. Even worse, it seems as though it fails to fetch the last-heard position from Audible's servers before it starts playing, but still decides to update Audible to let it know that the _current_ position should now be considered the last-heard position. This can lead to a lot of frustrating fast-fowarding and hoping I'm not overshooting my target.

I've been thinking about this project for a while, but finally got around to starting it this past weekend. The idea is simple: poll Audible's servers periodically for last-heard positions on recently played books, store those positions in a timeseries database, and set up plotting for the timeseries data. This should enable me to see recent maximum positions before rewinds, and also help me find my start position of a listening session if I fell asleep before remembering to set a sleep timer.

For me, the easiest tools to set this up were python, prometheus, and grafana. I already have prometheus and grafana set up, so for this project I only needed to write a simple prometheus exporter for my audible data. I stumbled across an [audible](https://github.com/mkb79/audible) python package, busted out the old standby, [prometheus_client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python), and slapped together a quick script to query audible and publish my data as metrics. Just like that, I've got working charts!

<div class="center"><img src="images/audible-before.jpg" class="inline-half" /><img src="images/audible-after.jpg" class="inline-half" /></div>
<div class="caption center">Positions before and after playing</div>

<div class="center"><img src="images/audiobook.jpg" class="inline" /></div>
<div class="caption center">The resulting chart</div>

All told, it came together very quickly and, aside from some clunky first-time setup, it's working well! The real trick will be to see if it keeps working long enough to help me the next time I lose my place in a book.
