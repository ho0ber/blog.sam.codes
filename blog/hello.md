Summary: So this is a blog, or something like a blog. Mostly this is a placeholder while I find some content to drop here. I'll be migrating some content from my old blog, when I get the chance.

I have a variety of interests, many of which lend themselves to being shared in text rather than just video or audio:

* Software Development & DevOps
* Microcontrollers & Electronics (Arduino, etc)
* Ham Radio
* Electronic Music Production
* Live Audio & Recording
* Home Automation
* Photography
* Baking
* Fishing
* 
I'm sure I'll touch on all of these in this blog eventually.

If you want to contact me, feel free to send me an email at samuel.colburn@gmail.com.
