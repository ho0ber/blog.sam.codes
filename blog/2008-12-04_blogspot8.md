Summary: First things first, I wanted to note that a lot of my time and effort recently has gone into my new site: RatchetHead.net - A new community for those of the engineering profession in World of Warcraft.

First things first, I wanted to note that a lot of my time and effort recently has gone into my new site: [RatchetHead.net](RatchetHead.net) - A new community for those of the engineering profession in World of Warcraft.
Secondly, I wanted to share a bit of financial advice one of my company's executives gave us at our quarterly meeting:

> If, five years ago, you invested 1000 dollars in Delta Airlines, today you would have about 50 bucks.
>
> If you invested 1000 dollars in AIG, today you'd have nothing whatsoever.
>
> If you invested 1000 dollars in beer, drank it all and recycled the cans, you'd have about 200 bucks in refunds.
>
> So the moral of this story is "Drink heavily... and recycle!"
